# Othello Web Application Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for refactoring an existing Common Lisp-based Othello game into a modern web application. The new system will feature a graphical user interface (UI) developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with core game logic and AI compiled to WebAssembly for performance. The application will support multiple play modes, adjustable AI difficulty levels, and time controls, ensuring an optimized and simplified design while preserving the algorithmic details of the original implementation.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Game Functionality

- **Standard Rules**: The system shall implement standard Othello rules, including an 8x8 board setup, move validation, token flipping, and winner determination based on token count.
- **Board State**: The system shall maintain and update the current board state after each move.
- **Move Calculation**: The system shall calculate and provide a list of legal moves for the current player.
- **Play Modes**:
  - **Human vs. Human**: Two human players shall play on a single browser instance.
  - **Human vs. Computer**: A human player shall play against an AI opponent via the UI.
  - **Computer vs. Computer**: Two AI opponents shall play against each other.
- **Demonstration Mode**: Upon loading the UI, the system shall automatically start an Expert-level computer vs. computer game. If a demo game ends before user interaction, a new demo game shall begin automatically. This mode shall stop when the user initiates a new game.

### 2.2 User Interface

- **Technologies**: The UI shall be developed using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
- **Board Display**: The UI shall present an 8x8 Othello board with realistic-looking black and white tokens, featuring a 3D appearance (e.g., shadows or perspective effects).
- **Responsiveness**: The UI shall dynamically resize to support screen sizes ranging from mobile devices to desktops.
- **Game Information**: The UI shall display:
  - Current score (token count for each player).
  - Time remaining for AI players (when applicable).
  - The last move made.
- **User Options**: The UI shall provide controls for:
  - Starting a new game.
  - Selecting play mode (human vs. human, human vs. computer, computer vs. computer).
  - Choosing AI difficulty (Expert, Moderate, Easy).
  - Setting AI time controls (5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes per side, defaulting to 30 minutes).
- **Move Input**: Human players shall make moves by clicking on the board, with intuitive feedback for invalid moves or errors.

### 2.3 AI and Game Logic

- **Implementation**: Core game logic, including board state management, move validation, and AI decision-making, shall be written in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly.
- **AI Algorithm**: The AI shall use an efficient search algorithm (e.g., alpha-beta pruning) consistent with the original Lisp implementation (`pb-a-b.lsp`).
- **Difficulty Levels**:
  - **Expert**: Shall always select the move with the highest evaluation score (default mode).
  - **Moderate**: Shall randomly select between the top two moves with equal probability.
  - **Easy**: Shall randomly select between the top three moves with equal probability.
- **Move Availability**: If fewer moves are available than required by the difficulty level (e.g., only two moves in Easy mode), the AI shall randomly select from the available moves.
- **No Moves**: If no moves are available, the AI shall pass the turn to the next player until no moves remain for either player.
- **Time Controls**:
  - Options: 5, 15, 30 (default), or 60 minutes per side, configurable before the game starts.
  - Clock: Starts when the AI move decision function is called and stops when the move is returned.
  - Timeout: If the AI exceeds its total time, it shall make random valid moves until the game ends.
- **Invalid Moves**: If the AI attempts an invalid move, it shall forfeit the game, supporting future machine learning extensions.
- **Board State**: The WebAssembly module shall maintain the current board state and perform all move-related calculations.

### 2.4 Communication

- **API**: The JavaScript UI and WebAssembly module shall communicate asynchronously using events or a messaging system.
- **Data Flow**:
  - The UI shall send user moves to the WebAssembly module.
  - The WebAssembly module shall return AI moves, updated board states, and debug information.
- **Debug Messages**: The WebAssembly module shall send debug messages to JavaScript, including:
  - Decision depth.
  - Chosen move position.
  - Current score.
  - Time remaining.
  - Time taken (in seconds).
- **Logging**: Debug messages shall be logged to the browser console by default.

### 2.5 Build and Deployment

- **Web Server**: The application (HTML, JS, and WebAssembly files) shall be served via a standard web server (e.g., Apache).
- **Directory Structure**:
  - C++ source code in a `src` folder.
  - Object files in an `obj` folder.
  - Compiled WebAssembly binary in a `bin` folder.
- **Build Process**:
  - A `makefile` shall compile the C++ code to WebAssembly.
  - A `configure.sh` script shall:
    - Detect compilers and dependencies.
    - Download and install missing or outdated tools into a `utility` subfolder.
- **Cleanup**: The `make clean` command shall remove compiled object files, the WebAssembly binary, and configuration data generated by `configure.sh`.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**:
  - The UI shall be responsive and provide a smooth user experience.
  - The WebAssembly module shall perform calculations efficiently to meet AI time constraints.
- **Security**: Standard web security practices (e.g., input sanitization) shall be followed.
- **Usability**: The UI shall be intuitive, with clear instructions and feedback for all users.

## 4. Future Considerations

- The system shall be designed with modularity to support future enhancements, such as integrating machine learning for the AI in Phase II. The AI forfeiture mechanism for invalid moves is intended to facilitate this transition.

## 5. Constraints

- **Algorithmic Fidelity**: The refactored code shall preserve the algorithmic details of the original Lisp code (e.g., move generation, evaluation in `pb-a-b.lsp`, and board management in `routines.lsp`).
- **Platform**: The system shall run in modern web browsers supporting WebAssembly.
- **Compilation**: WebAssembly shall be compiled on a Linux-based OS using standard tools (e.g., Emscripten).

## 6. Assumptions

- Users have modern web browsers capable of running WebAssembly.
- The web server is configured to serve the required files correctly.

## 7. Dependencies

- **Compilation**: Tools like Emscripten for C++ to WebAssembly compilation.
- **Web Development**: Standard tools for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development.

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

- The system shall correctly implement Othello rules and handle all game scenarios (e.g., no moves, game end).
- The UI shall be visually appealing, responsive across screen sizes, and fully functional.
- The AI shall operate according to the specified difficulty levels and time controls.
- The build process shall successfully compile the WebAssembly module.
- Debug information shall be accurately logged to the console.

This document provides a comprehensive guide for refactoring the Othello game into a modern web application, balancing performance, usability, and future extensibility.
